This this project is test project for Think cell interview.
First of all, it didn't pass this:
```
Correctness: Your program should produce a working interval_map
with the behavior described above. In particular, pay attention
to the validity of iterators. It is illegal to dereference end iterators. 
Consider using a checking STL implementation such as the one shipped
with Visual C++ or GCC
```
Have no idea what was the exactly wrong.

Task details provided in cpp file.

Most of the tests cases that comes into my mind are provided in the main.cpp
